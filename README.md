Hey there! I'm Merrik Wright, a passionate and curious developer with a strong interest in embedded systems, game development, and UI/UX design. I’m currently studying computer science and building cool projects that bridge the gap between hardware and software, whether that’s crafting interactive menus in GameMaker or wiring up sensors on a Raspberry Pi.

My GitHub is home to a variety of projects I’ve worked on, ranging from C++ and Python scripts to full-fledged game systems and system architecture assignments. I love solving problems, learning new tools, and refining my code to be clean, efficient, and human-readable.

When I'm not programming, you might find me running a D&D campaign, collecting trading cards, or exploring the latest tech trends. I'm always open to collaboration and feedback, so feel free to check out my work or drop me a message!
